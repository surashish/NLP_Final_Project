M1.1. Fines:

[Inform: the following is in regards to fines]



M1.2. I know you have talked with Phillip but I wanted to give my two cents.

[Inform: though John has talked with Phillip, Hunter wants to give opinion]

M1.3. I think the fines are a great idea.

M1.4. We must be accountable for VAR.

[Inform: Hunter thinks fines are a great idea, because they must be accountable for VAR]

M1.5. However the fines do not allow the desks to push the envelope.

M1.6. The desks need to stay a couple million under VAR to protect against volatility and factor changes.

[Inform: fines do not allow desks to push limits/desks must stay a couple million under VAR for safety]

M1.7. We do not have the tools to predict our VAR with any strong degree of accuracy

M1.8. but we are penalized for going over a few hundred thousand dollars.

[Inform: they cannot predict VAR with much accuracy but are penalized for exceeding limit by a few hundred thousand dollars]

M1.9. I propose a one day grace period of 10% to 12% over limit.

M1.10. This would allow the desks to max their VAR and protect against unexpected changes.

[Inform: Hunter thinks there should be a one day grace period of 10-12% over limit, which would allow desks to maximize VAR and protect against unforeseen changes]



M1.11. EOL:

[Inform: the following is in regards to EnronOnline]



M1.12. We continue to have trouble with brokers not working our EOL numbers.

[Inform: they continually have trouble with brokers not working their EnronOnline numbers]



M1.13. We believe Dynegy has written a program to mirror our cash markets on their system.

[Inform: Hunter thinks Dynegy has written a program to reflect EnronOnline's cash markets on their system]

Sflink1.13

M1.14. When we suspend, they suspend

M1.15. and as our markets move, so do theirs.

[Inform: describing Dynegy's program that reflects EnronOnline's cash markets]

[DUPLICATE]

Fines:



I know you have talked with Phillip but I wanted to give my two cents.  I think the fines are a great idea. We must be accountable for VAR.  However the fines do not allow the desks to push the envelope.  The desks need to stay a couple million under VAR to protect against volatility and factor changes.  We do not have the tools to predict our VAR with any strong degree of accuracy but we are penalized for going over a few hundred thousand dollars.  I propose a one day grace period of 10% to 12% over limit.  This would allow the desks to max their VAR and protect against unexpected changes.



EOL:



We continue to have trouble with brokers not working our EOL numbers.



We believe Dynegy created a program to mirror our cash markets on their system. When we suspend, they suspend and as our markets move, so do theirs.
