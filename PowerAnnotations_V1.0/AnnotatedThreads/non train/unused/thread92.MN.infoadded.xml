M1.1. Greg/Andy/Kal --

[Conventional: salutation]

M1.2. Not clear to me if this is strictly Accenture's work for Credit or for EOL.

M1.3. Not sure if they've worked for us,

[Inform: Vance is unclear about whether something is strictly Accenture's work or whether they have worked for the email recipients]

M1.4. but I presume we don't want them taking ANY credit for our success given our origination goals and messages!

[Inform: Vance presumes that his colleagues don't want Accenture taking any credit for Enron's success]

M2.1. Andy --

[Conventional: salutation]

M2.2. To make a long e-mail chain below short --

M2.3. a reporter from the Economist interviewed Jeff Skilling and Greg Piper about what makes Enron successful in e-Commerce.

[Inform: summary of a long email chain/an Economist reporter interviewed two Enron employees about what makes the company successful in e-Commerce]

M2.4. Since he knows Accenture is one of our consulting companies, he contacted them to ask them the same question.

[Inform: the reporter asked Accenture the same question]

M2.5. Their PR dept. and ours is asking for direction on whether Accenture should talk to this reporter.

[Inform: Accenture's and Enron's PR are trying to figure out whether Accenture should talk to the reporter]

M2.6. Mike and I think we should just request Accenture to not talk to this reporter

M2.7. since they are under a confidentiality agreement with Enron.

[Inform: Mike and Kal think Accenture shouldn't talk to the reporter due to a confidentiality agreement]

M2.8. I'll let our PR dept know, unless you feel otherwise.

[Inform: Kal will let Enron's PR dept know this unless Andy disagrees]
