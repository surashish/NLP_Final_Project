M3.1. We will need to keep reminding them of how much money they are making when

they start to complain about the construction cost.

[Inform: Bob et al. need to remind others of how much money they are making if they complain about construction cost]

M3.2. By the time we get power

there, install the flow control equipment, and install the new EFM, we will

probably be close to $70,000.

[Inform: by the time Bob et al. get power to and install equipment and EFM for the new EOG well (presumably), they will have spent almost $70,000]
