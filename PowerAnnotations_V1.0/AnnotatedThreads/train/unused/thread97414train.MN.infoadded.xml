M1.1. The reason I asked about Chris Sevrens is that he was on the list (you'll see) of this email.

[Inform-AnswerOffline: Kevin asked about Chris because he was on the list of a presumably forwarded email]

M1.2. I don't know if you heard about it but

the author of the email got fired shortly after it circulated through Wall St.

[Inform: author of email got fired a short time after it circulated through Wall Street]

M1.3. Anyway, thought you might find it amusing.

[Inform: sender thought Vince (M?) might find this amusing]

M1.4. Start from

the bottom of this email and work your way up.

[Inform: Vince (M?) should read email from the bottom up]

M1.5. It's interesting to see the path it took to so many people.

[Inform: Kevin thinks it is interesting to see the path it took to reach many people]
