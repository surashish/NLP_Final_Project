M2.1. Steph,

[Conventional: salutation]

M2.2. further to our discussion, Pls review. [Y]

[Request-Action: review presumably attached Gas Inventories document]

Flink2.2

M2.3. I took a quick look at the locations and most appear to be East based.

[Inform: most locations seem to be East-based]  

M2.4. You might want to use an analyst to figure this out.

[Inform: Steph might have use for an analyst in figuring this out]

M2.5. Also, they have valued the inventories off of the Nymex only ( or so it appears) and I would have to believe that the value of these molecules is materially different than this.

[Inform: inventories are valued off of NY Mercantile Exchange only and Barry believes molecules' value is different from this]

M2.6. Pls review and let's discuss asap. [Y]

[Request-Action: review so Steph and Barry can discuss this]
