M1.1. Mr. Lay--

[Conventional: salutation]

contribute to the Arena referendum campaign, Mike Goldberg of Baker & Botts

against other contributions that they solicited.

you did not want to be competing with the Rockets in soliciting

contributions to the Arena referendum campaign.

have solicited from Baker & Botts, Jim MacInvale and Tilman Fertitta.

[Inform: Mike Goldberg's request for permission on behalf of the Rockets when he called Friday]

Hierarchical Power Annotation:
Person_1: Kenneth Lay
Person_2: Rosalee Fleming
Reason: From messages 2 and 3, from the way Rosalee speaks on Ken Lay's behalf, it seems like she is his secretary. Also, it is known that he was the chairman and CEO of Enron.

Situational Power Annotation:
Person_1: Kenneth Lay
Person_2: Michael S Telle
Reason: In message 1, Michael asks for Ken's permission, but it is apparent from his email address that he belongs to a law firm, so he is not part of the corporate hierarchy at Enron (i.e. this is not hierarchical power).
