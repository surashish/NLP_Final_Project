M3.1. I have the org chart that Brian showed to the Denver employees last Friday.

[Inform: Robert has org chart that Brian showed to Denver employees last Friday]

M3.2. First let me emphasize that the org chart reflects positions to be held by

the Denver employees in the asset company now named and known as NBP Energy

Pipelines LLC.

[Inform: org chart shows positions to be held by Denver employees in NBP Energy]

M3.3. (The Denver employees are engaged in selecting a new name for

the asset company.)

[Inform: Denver employees are choosing a new name for asset company]

M3.4. For example, the fact that Dan Bump will be a Vice

President at the asset company does not mean that he is a VP at ENA or at

GPG.

[Inform: even though Dan will be a VP at asset company doesn't mean he is a VP at ENA or GPG]

M3.5. The reason for the lengthy explanation is that the org chart

incorrectly is titled "NBP Services Corporation Organization."

[Inform: incorrect title of org chart, which accounts for long explanation]

M3.6. Also that

document was prepared in Denver and I can not attach it to this note.

[Inform: document was prepared in Denver and Robert cannot attach it to this email]

M3.7. The

chart needs to be retitled and attached to the LOU.

[Inform: chart needs to be renamed and attached to LOU]

M3.8. I will carry the chart

(with its incorrect title to Eva).

[Inform: Robert will carry chart with incorrect title to Eva]
