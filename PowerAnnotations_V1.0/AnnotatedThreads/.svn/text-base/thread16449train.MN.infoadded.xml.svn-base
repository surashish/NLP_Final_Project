M1.1. Please give me your views ASAP. [Y]

[Request-Information: recipients' views]

Flink1.1

M1.2. Thanks for the language.

[Conventional: thanks]

M1.3. We will make sure that weather derivatives are

included.

[Inform: Kenneth et al. will make sure weather derivatives are included]

M1.4. We met with the CFTC yesterday and they oppose excluding energies

from the Act.

[Inform: CFTC opposes excluding energies from the Act]

M1.5. Our bill would require that these excluded products, if traded

on

an electronic trading system, to be subject to the antimanipulation authority

of

the CFTC and not allow these products to require delivery.

[Inform: what bill would require for excluded products]

M1.6. One issue they

raised was price discovery and that these markets are not very transparent.

[Inform: issue of price discovery was raised]

M1.7. What would be your reaction if we added a third provision (again this is only

for energies traded on a electronic trading facility--bilateral transactions

would not be subject to these provisions) that required some sort of price

disclosure for these markets.

[Request-Information: recipients' opinions on adding a third provision that requires price disclosure for energies traded on an electronic trading facility]

Flink1.7

M1.8. That might help placate the CFTC, but I'm not

sure what the industry reaction might be.

[Inform: this might help placate CFTC, but Kenneth is not sure what industry reaction would be]

M1.9. Let me know. [Y]

[Inform: recipients should tell Kenneth what they think]

M2.1. I have conferred with industry representatives on the CFTC's suggestion.

[Inform: Kenneth has conferred with industry representatives on CFTC's suggestion]

M2.2. We

have a problem with it from a couple of perspectives:

[Inform: the following are a couple of problems with the suggestion]

M2.3. 1.  Although NYMEX is the benchmark for pricing of a few energy commodities,

most of the pricing of transactions is done based on price reporting services

such as Platt's, Megawatt Daily and Reuters.

M2.4. These services collect

information on transactions from industry representatives and report usually

on a daily basis benchmark prices for a large number of energy commodities.

M2.5. This activity has never been regulated by anyone.

M2.6. Obviously, these price

reporting services have provided valuable price information to the

industry.

M2.7. We do not see a need for regulation of price reporting whether it

from a price reporting service or an electronic trading system.

[Inform: the first problem is that Kenneth et al. do not think price reporting should be regulated, wherever it comes from, since price reporting services provide valuable price information for the industry]

M2.8. 2.  We are concerned that the manner in which the CFTC would regulate/oversee

price reporting would be very awkward and difficult.

M2.9. The drafting of such a

provision would be complex and the discretion it would give the CFTC to

potentially regulate through price reporting would be troubling.

[Inform: the second problem is that the way the CFTC would regulate or oversee price reporting would likely be awkward and difficult]

M2.10. We are very interested in achieving the exclusion that the draft legislation

currently provides.

[Inform: Kenneth et al. are interested in maintaining the product exclusion that the draft legislation currently provides]

M2.11. We would be prepared to discuss the matter further in

the hope of maintaining the exclusion.

[Inform: sender et al. are prepared to discuss this issue further]

M2.12. Please let me know what you think.

[Request-Information: recipients' opinions]
