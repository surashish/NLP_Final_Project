M1.1. Andy,

[Conventional: salutation]



M1.2. Attached are some ideas for possible charge structures for EnronOnline.

M1.3. I am recommending something which will probably be surprising, given our conversation.

M1.4. Let's discuss when you have a moment.

[Inform: ideas attached/surprising recommendation/would like to discuss]



M1.5. Dave

[Conventional: signature]





M1.6. Recommendation

[Inform: following is recommendation]



M1.7. a) For new commodity areas, continue to charge a set up fee in accordance with our previously agreed schedule.

M1.8. (e.g. $350,000 for new Market Area)

[Inform: charge set up fee for new commodity areas in accordance with previously agreed-upon schedule]

Sflink1.8



M1.9. b) Charge a per-volume maintenance fee which is comparable to industry brokerage fees,

M1.10. with a minimum charge equivalent to $4,000 per Product * Total number of Products).

[Inform: charge a per-value maintenance fee comparable to industry brokerage fee with minimum charge]

Sflink1.10



M1.11. This method results in a total charge of approx. $46.5 million pa.

M1.12. (providing coverage for existing charges, some growth and London's charges)

[Inform: total charge/provides coverage for existing charges and other things]



M1.13. This method is recommended because it balances a fee to reflect real expenditure of effort on behalf on Enron Online staff (the per Product minimum)

M1.14. with a structure which is recognizeable (and hopefully more easily sold) to the traders.

[Inform: this method is recommended/its structure is more recognizable to traders]



M1.15. This structure is primarily not cost-driven, but is value-driven;

M1.16. those who derive the greatest value pay the highest costs.

[Inform: is value-driven/those who derive greatest value pay highest amounts]







M1.17 Example Charges

[Inform: following are example charges]



M1.18 Here are some example charges if we use the recommended method:





M1.19 Commodity			Charge



US Nat Gas			$24,282,875

US Power			$  5,163,563

Metals				$  5,798,144

Crude &amp; Products		$  3,578,560

Norwegian Power		$     380,869

Global Credit			$     400,000

Coal				$     966,265

Bandwidth 			$     312,000





M1.20 Or, by Group:



ENA		$30,647,772

EEL		$  8,774,844

EGM		$  6,741,955

EIM		$     106,250

EBS		$     312,000

Total:		$46,582,821

[Inform: 2 charts illustrating example charges by commodity or group]



M1.21 Sensitivity

[Inform: following is "Sensitivity"]



M1.22 With the recommended structure, if transactions for 2001 are:

[Inform: following is a list of possible numbers of transactions for 2001]



M1.23 a) The same as the last half of 2000 * 2, then we recover approx. $46 million.

[Inform: if same as 2nd half of 2000 * 2, then recover about $46 million]



M1.24 b) Double, then we recover approx. $90 million

[Inform: if double 2nd half of 2000 * 2, then recover about $90 million]



M1.25 c) Half, then we recover approx.$24 million

[Inform: if half of 2nd half of 2000 * 2, then recover about $24 million]



M1.26 c) Zero, then we recover approx. $6.4 million

[Inform: if nothing, then recover about $6.4 million]





M1.27 Alternatives - Basic Structure

[Inform: the following are alternatives using the basic charge structure]



M1.28 Any of the following could be combined to create additional alternatives:

[Inform: any of the following could be combined to create more alternatives]



M1.29 Alternative 1: As per the recommended structure, but charge a flat per-transaction fee instead of a per volume fee. This would result in a charge of $xx per transaction.

[Inform: alternative 1, flat per-transaction fee]

Sflink1.29



M1.30 Alternative 2: Charge by Product Types (we currently have 358, so full charge would be approx. $112,000 per Product Type)

[Inform: alternative 2, charge by product types]



M1.31 Alternative 3: Charge by Products (we currently have 1500 per day, so full charge would be approx. $27,000 per Product)

[Inform: alternative 3, charge by products]



M1.32 Alternative 4: Charge by Country/Commodity (we currently have 61, so full charge would be approx. $656,000 per Country/Commodity)

[Inform: alternative 4, charge by country/commodity]



M1.33 Alternative 5: Use the same methodology as currently used for the cost allocation (55% of cost allocation based on number of transactions and 45% based on Country/Commodity Markets Served) This would result in transaction charges of approx. xxx per transaction and $295,000 per Market served.

[Inform: alternative 5, same methodology as currently used for cost allocation]





M1.34 Alternatives - Different Structures

[Inform: the following is a list of alternatives using different structures]



M1.35 Alternative 5: Separate Marketing costs and charge directly to business units based on activity

[Inform: alternative 5[sic], separate marketing costs/charge directly to business units based on activity]



M1.36 Alternative 6: Separate Development costs as a separate item not covered by the basic charge structure, but recovered solely through increases in EnronOnline business.

[Inform: alternative 6[sic], separate development costs not covered by basic charge structure/recovered only through increases in EnronOnline business]

M2.1. Okay. good start.

[Inform: good start]



M2.2. I like the idea of a minimum for each product,

[Inform: Andy Zipper likes minimum for each product]

Blink1.10



M2.3. and I like staying with existing structure for new products.

[Inform: Andy Zipper likes staying w/existing structure for new products]

Blink1.8



M2.4. Let's look at alternative 1, the flat fee per trade,

M2.5. and see what it would need to be to yield $35mm in revs based on average tradecount YTD,

M2.6. i.e. extraplolate that out for rest of year for a pro forma. [Y]

[Inform: likes flat fee per trade/would like to see what is needed to yield $35mm in revenues]

M3.1. Sorry - xxx (below) was supposed to be replaced with $54.50 per transaction,

M3.2. which is based on 2 * the July00-Dec00 transaction count.

M3.3. Note this results in $40 million of recovery, which includes Amita's costs.

[Inform: explaining "xx" in Alternative 1- Basic Structure]

Blink1.29



M3.5. If you just look at $35 million recovery, the per-transaction fee is $47.68.

[Inform: per-transaction fee of $35 million recovery]

Blink2.6



M3.6. This structure has the advantage that it is a little closer to the current cost allocation methodology,

M3.7. but this methodology is not well known by the business units.

[Inform: advantage/disadvantage of this structure]



M3.8. I actually started drafting this email with Alternative 1 as the recommendation,

M3.9. but decided that if we have to sell this internally, the brokerage lookalike structure would be easer to sell and defend.

[Inform: brokerage lookalike structure better than Alternative 1]

M5.1. Sure.

[Commit: David will send commission numbers]

Blink4.1



M5.2. These are actually taken directly from the spreadsheet which Mike Bridges prepared several months ago.

[Inform: numbers taken directly from spreadsheet]



M5.3. If this is a route you want to pursue, we should first verify each of the numbers as current.

[Inform: must verify numbers as correct before pursuing this route]
