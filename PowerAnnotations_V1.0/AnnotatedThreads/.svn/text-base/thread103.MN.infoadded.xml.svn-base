M2.1. John,

[Conventional: salutation]

M2.2. Tim's view is the main reason I am trying to sell these tolls.

[Inform: Tim's view is why Chris is trying to sell these tolls]

M2.3. We sold our Las Vegas toll on-line (Dealbench) and I thought about putting these into EOL.

[Inform: they sold their Las Vegas toll online and Chris might want to put them into Enron Online]

M2.4. However, different companies want different delivery points, start dates and implied heat rates.

[Inform: different companies want different rates/dates/delivery points]

M2.5. I think we have whet their appetite for the structure - if they don't transact, I think we should put a couple of structures online.

[Inform: if they don't transact, Chris thinks some structures should be put online]

M2.6. Sometimes the formality of a competitive auction makes people transact - and bid higher!
