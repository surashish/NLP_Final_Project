M1.1. I have tentatively booked us on the QE2 sailing from Southampton at 5pm on August 29, arriving New York at 7:30am on September 4.

[Inform: Mark tentatively booked places for Linda and him on QE2]

M1.2. You and Amanda have a Caronia class cabin at $2045.32 per person, including air from New York to London (with a business class upgrade on Continental).

[Inform: cost of cabin for Linda and Amanda, including airfare]

M1.3. I have a single in the same class (so we eat in the same restaurant).

[Inform: Mark has a room in same class as Linda and Amanda, so they will eat in the same restaurant]

M1.4. My plan would be to fly over on Sunday evening - the 26th - since I have to be in Ohio that morning.

[Inform: when Mark plans to fly to London]

M1.5. With that in mind I have also booked jr. suites for us at "41" the all-inclusive London hotel near Buckingham Palace that I've mentioned to you before.

[Inform: Mark booked suites at a hotel in London]

M1.6. They are at 275 GBP per night (2 nights).

[Inform: nightly cost of suites]

M1.7. Of course, if you guys wanted to go earlier to spend more time in London, I am sure that would be possible.

[Inform: it is ok if Linda and Amanda want to arrive in London earlier than Mark]

M1.8. The difficulty is that Amanda has indicated an interest in staying in Europe longer - certainly understandable.

[Inform: Amanda wants to stay in Europe longer]

M1.9. Her preference would be to go over on the boat leaving NY on September 5, arriving in Southampton Sept. 10 and then stay in Europe for a few weeks.

[Inform: Amanda wants to take the return boat ride, from New York to London]

Sflink1.9   

M1.10. That doesn't work quite as well for me because I only have 6 vacation days left and on that routing I get one less day in London - i.e. we get off the boat on Monday morning and I have to fly back Tuesday morning.

[Inform: Mark doesn't like this plan as much]

M1.11. On the other hand, we wouldn't be jet lagged on arrival in London!

[Inform: the plus side is that they will not be jet-lagged when they get to London]

M1.12. They will hold the reservation until tomorrow.

[Inform: reservation held until tomorrow]

M1.13. What's your preference?

[Request-Information: Linda's preference]

[Inform: joke about Mark thinking Linda is a fool]

M2.2. No way I am getting in the middle of you and Amanda on vacation plans.

[Inform: joke about not wanting to get between Mark and Amanda on their vacation plans]

Blink1.9

M2.3. I'll just pack my little bag and wait at the dock until you two show up.

[Inform: joke about Linda packing her bag and waiting for Mark and Amanda to show up]
