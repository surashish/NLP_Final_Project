M1.1. Pam,

[Conventional: salutation]

M1.2. I don't see why the clearing of 41 is a prerequisite.

[Inform: Dan doesn't know why 41 must be cleared]

M1.3. Let's just get it moved from 4th to where ever so people can see it.

[Inform: they should move 41 (or its contents, if it is a room) to somewhere more visible]  

M1.4. I've got a whole floor of people apprehensive about the move and wasting time talking about what the working enviornment might be like when we finally move back.

[Inform: Dan knows many people who are unhappy about the move]

M1.5. We've got enough to worry about, this isn't worth the noise.

[Inform: Dan thinks this isn't worth all the noise that will ensue]

M1.6. If people just see it, they will understand that this is not going to be a minimum footprint sardine pack, and any noise will stop.

[Inform: if people see this, noise will end]

M1.7. When can we expect it to be available for viewing.

[Request-Information: when can 41 be available for viewing]

M1.10. We were supposed to move yesterday, we're all packed up in boxes, and nobody seems to know what happened or when we are moving now.
