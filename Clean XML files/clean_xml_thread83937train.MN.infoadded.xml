M1.1. We need to get something for Ina for Admin Asst's Day - it is tomorrow.

[Inform: recipients need to get something for Ina for Administrative Assistants' Day]

M1.2. I

will take a collection of $10 from each person and get a gift certificate

from Foley's if that is okay with everyone.

[Inform: Tori will collect $10 from everyone and get a gift certificate from Foley's if everyone agrees to it]

M1.3. I will probably have to go get

the gift certificate tonight - so please dont stick me with more than my

share of the bill.

[Inform: Tori will probably have to get gift certificate tonight, so would not like to have to pay more than everyone else]

M1.4. ( Thats what happened last time)

[Inform: last time, Tori ended up paying more than her share]

M1.5. Thanks.

[Conventional: thanks]
