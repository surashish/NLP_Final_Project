M1.1. Fines:

[Inform: the following is in regards to fines]



M1.2. I know you have talked with Phillip but I wanted to give my two cents.

[Inform: though John has talked with Phillip, Hunter wants to give opinion]

M1.3. I think the fines are a great idea.

M1.4. We must be accountable for VAR.

[Inform: Hunter thinks fines are a great idea, because they must be accountable for VAR]

M1.5. However the fines do not allow the desks to push the envelope.

M1.6. The desks need to stay a couple million under VAR to protect against volatility and factor changes.

[Inform: fines do not allow desks to push limits/desks must stay a couple million under VAR for safety]

M1.7. We do not have the tools to predict our VAR with any strong degree of accuracy

M1.8. but we are penalized for going over a few hundred thousand dollars.

[Inform: they cannot predict VAR with much accuracy but are penalized for exceeding limit by a few hundred thousand dollars]

M1.9. I propose a one day grace period of 10% to 12% over limit.

M1.10. This would allow the desks to max their VAR and protect against unexpected changes.

[Inform: Hunter thinks there should be a one day grace period of 10-12% over limit, which would allow desks to maximize VAR and protect against unforeseen changes]



M1.11. EOL:

[Inform: the following is in regards to EnronOnline]



M1.12. We continue to have trouble with brokers not working our EOL numbers.

[Inform: they continually have trouble with brokers not working their EnronOnline numbers]



M1.13. We believe Dynegy has written a program to mirror our cash markets on their system.

[Inform: Hunter thinks Dynegy has written a program to reflect EnronOnline's cash markets on their system]

Sflink1.13

M1.14. When we suspend, they suspend

M1.15. and as our markets move, so do theirs.

[Inform: describing Dynegy's program that reflects EnronOnline's cash markets]
