M1.7. I wouldnt push the sales hat too far though, the duration of contracts on this pipeline do not favorably compare to those on most pipelines in general -- in other words, you could be staring at a "hole" in '04.

[Inform: Mark recommends not pushing sales hat too far, for reasons given]

Sflink1.7

M1.8. (Once I get the precise numbers from the bankers, I'll plug them in -- the answer shouldnt change more than 5%).

[Request-Information: next step for Mark]
