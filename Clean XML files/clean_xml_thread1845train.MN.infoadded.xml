M1.1. Two questions:

[Inform: Robert has two questions]

M1.2. 1.  How do we fight the notion that a FERC retroactive determination of "just and reasonable rates" should be re-injected into the calculation of negative CTCs?

[Request-Information: how do Robert et al. argue against a new calculation of negative CTCs by the FERC]

Flink1.2

M1.3. It seems to me that there are at least equitable arguments against that.

[Inform: Robert believes there are equitable arguments against this]

Sflink1.3

M1.4. Will this be a CPUC or FERC issue?

[Request-Information: is this a CPUC or FERC issue]

Flink1.4

M1.5. 2.  Can we use the utilities' underscheduling to push them back on this, legally or in negotiations?

[Request-Information: can Robert et al. use the utilities' underscheduling to push them back on this]

Flink1.5

M1.6. Since they contributed to the market disfunction, shouldn't they have to live with the consequences?

[Request-Information: if they contributed to the market dysfunction, should they not suffer the consequences]

M2.1. On point #1 - I think that at the end of the day, FERC will not deal with the Negative CTC directly.

M2.2. All they will do is reset prices.

[Inform: FERC will not deal with the negative CTC directly, but will only reset prices]

Blink1.4

M2.3. The Utilities and the CPUC will then have to decide the legality and the equity of modifying the PX Credit and hence the Negative CTC.

[Inform: Utilities and CPUC will decide legality and equity of modifying PX Credit and thus negative CTC]

Blink1.3

M2.4. We have tried in the CA Refund process to highlight the fact that much of the "high" prices were due to inappropriate policy and actions of the CPUC, Governor, and Utilities.

[Inform: Jim et al. have tried to stress that the CPUC, governor, and Utilities were responsible for so-called high prices]

M2.5. The core problem with this line of argument is that the Refund process didn't ask the first question - what or who is to blame.

M2.6. It simply took dysfunction and ran.

[Inform: the problem with this argument is that the Refund process didn't ask who/what was to blame]

M2.7. We are trying in the context of the Rehearing case to ask FERC to restart with the right question.

[Inform: Jim et. al. are trying to ask FERC to ask first who is to blame in the context of the Rehearing case]

M2.8. Also, remember that we aren't going to have a solution in the FERC case until sometime next year, probably after SCE gets its money.

[Inform: they likely won't have a solution in this case until after SCE gets its money next year]

M2.9. Finally, I think that the right policy decision is not to "re-bill" Negative CTC but rather to prospectively recover the costs.

[Inform: Jim thinks that the right thing to do is prospectively recover costs, not re-bill negative CTC]

Blink1.2

M2.10. On point #2 - See point above.

[Inform: the above point that Jim made relates to second point in previous email]

M2.11. I doubt, however, that all "high" prices can be seen as just a result of underscheduling.

[Inform: Jim doubts that all so-called high prices can be seen as just the result of underscheduling]

Blink1.5

M2.12. Jim
