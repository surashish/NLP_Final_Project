M2.1. Thanks Mark!

[Conventional: thanks]

M2.2. I misunderstood Robbi's mail - I thought you had been working

on the sections of the MSA discussed initially in my mail.

[Inform: misunderstanding about Robbi's mail]

Blink1.5

Sflink2.2

M2.3. However, it would be very helpful if you could identify those portions of the

US MSA that are there solely for US regulatory purposes - they may not be

necessary in the European version and would inevitably cause discussions with

European CP's, where the argument that they refer to US regulatory

requirements may not be easily accepted.

[Inform: Peter would like Mark to identify parts of the US MSA that are there solely for US, rather than European, regulatory purposes]

Sflink2.3

M2.4. Section 10.2(ii) is the one below,

which I would be happy if we could delete for Europe:

[Inform: section 10.2(ii) is posted below, which Peter would like to delete for Europe]

M2.5. (i) it is (a) in connection with each Product, a commercial participant who,

in connection with its activities, incurs risk, in addition to price risk,

related to such Product, has a demonstrable capacity or ability, directly or

through separate bona fide contractual arrangements, to provide or accept

such Product under the terms of a Transaction and (b) is either (1) a

corporation, partnership, organization, trust or other business entity with a

net worth exceeding US$1,000,000 (or the equivalent thereof in any foreign

currency) or has total assets exceeding US$5,000,000 (or the equivalent

thereof in any foreign currency) or (2) an entity, the obligations of which

under this Agreement are guaranteed or otherwise supported by a letter of

credit or keepwell support, or other agreement by any such entity or by an

entity referred to in subsection (b)(1) above;
