M3.1. I would like for us to take a look at charging Peerless some sort of number based on the market price for leased storage.

[Inform: Dan would like to charge Peerless some amount]

M3.2. I talked to a guy in the Enron liquids group who said that 2-oil tankage in the Caribbean goes for about $0.25- $0.30 per barrel per month.

[Inform: monthly per barrel price of 2-oil tankage in the Caribbean]

M3.3. If we leased them only 150,000 bbls of capacity in the tank and kept the rest for ourselves, that would be around $40,000/month.

[Inform: monthly charge if Peerless is leased 150,000 bbls of capacity in the tank]

M3.4. The actual number could be whatever we are comfortable with keeping in storage as minimums.

[Inform: actual number whatever Enron is comfortable keeping in storage as minimum]

M3.5. If we could get something out of it every month and still sell them our inventory that would be great.

[Inform: would be great if they could make a monthly profit and still sell Peerless their inventory]

M3.6. But I would also like to know how it looks in case they wouldn't go for that and we had to hold title to whatever oil we already have in the tank.

M3.7. Then we could still have some sort of pricing mechanism for buying and selling oil to each other in the tank.

[Inform: if Peerless does not agree to this, Enron should still have a pricing mechanism for buying/selling oil to each other in the tank]

M3.8. From what I heard from Peerless, they would plan to unload vessels into Eco's tank,

M3.9. then transfer out of that tank to their other tanks when needed.

[Inform: from what Dan heard, Peerless plans to unload vessels into Eco's tank and transfer out to other tanks when needed]

M3.10. Whatever the case would be, we would have to have controls on quality in our tank,

M3.11. and insist on seeing the analysis on everything before it goes into the tank.

[Inform: Enron would have to have quality controls/insist on seeing analysis of anything that goes into tank]
