M1.1. Steve,

[Conventional: salutation]

M1.2. Per your advice, I have removed the "excessive heat" allegation in the petition.

[Inform: Britt removed an allegation about excessive heat from a petition, as Steve had suggested]

M1.3. How does it look to you now?

[Request-Information: what does Steve think about the petition now]

Flink1.3

M1.4. Please let me know at your earliest convenience.

[Inform: Britt would like to know soon]

M1.5. You confirmed that while we know for sure that the contamination didn't occur prior to October 28, and that it was discovered on or about November 4, we don't know for an absolute certainty that it didn't occur, say, on October 29, 1999.

[Inform: acknowledging the confirmation that date of contamination isn't certain]

M1.6. Accordingly, if Baytank won't grant us an extension of time to file suit against it (and you, Richard and Jim were bcc'd on the e-mail I just sent to the president of some Baytank entity asking for such an extension), then I want to be ready to file this suit on Friday.

[Inform: if Baytank won't grant an extension of time to file suit, Britt wants to be ready to file it on Friday]

M1.7. A related point:  I have included the name of the Baytank entity with whom Philchem executed the Marketing Agreement, which is the only Baytank corporate entity that I know of that had some responsibility for the contamination.

[Inform: Britt is including name of Baytank entity that had some responsibility for the contamination]

M1.8. However, the Marketing Agreement does not say whether that Baytank entity owns, leases or operates the facilities in question.

[Inform: the Marketing Agreement does not say anything about the Baytank entity's ownership or operation of the contaminated facilities]

M1.9. It would be preferable to name any and all Baytank entites that own, lease or operate the facility in question.

[Inform: Britt would like to name all responsible Baytank entities if possible]

M1.10. Short of calling Baytank and asking, do you know how we could find this out very quickly?

[Request-Information: does Steve know how to find out this information quickly]

Flink1.10

M1.11. Many thanks.

[Conventional: thanks]

M1.12. Britt

[Conventional: signature]

M1.13. P.S.:  Richard,  should I go ahead and send out a GC memo on this suit, in case Baytank doesn't promptly respond to my request for an extension of time?

[Request-Information: should Britt send a GC memo on the suit]

Flink1.13

M2.1. Steve,

[Conventional: salutation]

M2.2. 1.  With apologies, attached is the redrafted petition, removing the "excessive heat" allegation.

[Inform: a redrafted position is attached, and Britt apologizes]

M2.3. 2.  You told me that the only way to perhaps determine if other Baytank entities were involved was to ask Philchem, who might or might not know, and who would then be asking questions about what we were going to do next.

[Inform: Steve told Britt that the only way to know if other Baytank entities were involved was to ask Philchem]

M2.4. Britt

[Conventional: signature]

M2.5. P.S. to Richard:  I haven't heard back from Baytank's president, even though I left a voice-mail and sent an e-mail, which was shown on my e-mail receipts as having been read on Tuesday of this week.

[Inform: Britt hasn't heard back from Baytank's president, even though (s)he knows he read his/her email to him]

M2.6. In the e-mail, I specifically said that we may be filing suit this week if we didn't get an extension.

[Inform: in the email, Britt made clear what his/her intentions were regarding the lawsuit]

M2.7. For the sake of caution, I think we need to file suit Friday afternoon, for reasons I've mentioned previously.

[Inform: Britt still thinks they should file suit on Friday afternoon]

M2.8. Shouldn't I send out a GC memo now?

[Request-Information: should Britt send out a GC memo]

Flink2.8
