M2.1. I heard Whalley was neutral to the London Clearing thing.

[Inform: Greg Piper heard Greg Whalley was neutral to a London Clearing thing]



M2.2. My take on it is that we want both the trade and the information associated with it like who it was, etc.

[Inform: Greg Piper's take is that they want both the trade and associated info]

M2.3. In theory, that is true.

M2.4. The question is that in reality, is that sustainable.

[Inform: not sure that this is sustainable, though in theory this is true]

M2.5. In gas and power U. S., other than ICE we are able to do that for the most part.

[Inform: other than ICE, in gas and power US, they were able to do this for the most part]



M2.6. Andy Zipper had a good idea and is focusing on a subset of this which is finding a way for hedge funds, institutions and locals to get at our liquidity through a clearing agent.

[Inform: Andy Zipper's good idea and how he is acting upon it]

M2.7. These entities do not transact currently on EnronOnline because of credit restrictions

M2.8. so if we could set up a master user, like a clearing agent, then the agent would set up sub users like the funds and/or locals.

[Inform: entities Zipper is focusing on are not currently able to transact on EnronOnline, so a clearing agent should be set up]

M2.9. This should not effect Whalley's concern

M2.10. because all these trades, though anonymous, would be incremental.

[Inform: this should not affect Whalley's concern, because trades would be incremental]



M2.11. Your thoughts?

[Request-Information: any thoughts]
